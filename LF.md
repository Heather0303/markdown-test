## OBJECTIVES OF THE CLIENT + CHALLENGES

At the time of Seedlink’s engagement with Li & Fung, there was a three-year plan to move the organization towards speed, innovation and digitalization. As such, they were intent on identifying individuals with a “digital mindset” competency. Targeting a digital mindset had been identified as an important method by which to transform the Li & Fung workforce in both the present and in the future.
Their second key objective was effective internal mobility, or essentially internal recruitment. 
The third key objective was effective succession planning at the senior management level. They sought to leverage Seedlink’s technology to gain data-driven insights into individual suitability for promotion to key roles.

(3) Overview Of Regional Performance Of Competencies: **Europe Has Lowest Competency’s Correlation To Performance.**
*Problem Identified*: Top European performers do not necessarily hold the same set of skills as Asian ones.

Possible Reasons:
1) Most of Li & Fung’s European functions were acquired only in recent years 
2) Europe has a contrasting working environment to Asia

*Actionable Insight*: Design internal training campaign introducing skills and work approaches from one geo-region to another.
